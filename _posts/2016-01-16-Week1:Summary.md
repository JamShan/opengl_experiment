## Week1: Summary

1. `Computer Graphics: CS3241`
Managed to setup environment for OpenGL programming and successfully cloned the official
tutorial repository for practice.

2. `Visual Design: NM2212`
Prof McGhee seems like fun chap and is the first prof that I know to insist his class
to turn off any electonic devices. Next time I should probably sit closer to the white
board as the dim lighting make it really hard to see the slides.
